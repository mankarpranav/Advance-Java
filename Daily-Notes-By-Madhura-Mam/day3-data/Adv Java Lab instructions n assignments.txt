Day 1
1. Confirm that MySql  DB is working fine , using cmd prompt OR mysql workbench

2. Refer , to installation instructions , shared on 1st day of core Java.
2.1 JDK version : JDK 11
2.2 IDE : Eclipse STS 3.9.18
2.3 Create NEW workspace , for advanced java.
2.4 AS per the instructions : in "day1-data\day1_help\readmes\Installation steps for Tomcat.txt" add Apache Tomcat web server.
2.5 Confirm if it's starting properly , without any exceptions
2.6 Create dynamic web app n test index.html

3. Extract Java EE docs from : "Advance Java Software n Help\\web_prog_prerequisites\softwares n docs\javaee-api-8.0-javadoc.jar"

4. In index.html , add a link to test the servlet , deployed using annotations
(Servlet1)

5. In index.html , add another link to test the servlet , deployed using xml tags
(Servlet2)

Servlet1 should be loaded eagerly
Servlet2 should be loaded lazily


Confirm complete servlet life cycle
(by printing messages on the server console)

In individual labs , revise all of today's work .
Go through :readme Java EE.txt
If time permits : 
1. Create  advjava db in mysql 
Solve, using DB layered approach(Tester, DAO , DBUtils ,POJO,DB)

User signin 
Steps
1.Tables : users 
2. POJOs : User (voting status : boolean)
3 Create DBUtils: edit DB user name n pwd
openConnection : 
closeConnection

4. DAO
4.1 UserDao
User  authenticateUser(String email,String pwd) throws SqlException
4.2 Implementation class
5. Write a tester for testing this
(main class n not a servlet !)

Day 2
1. import day2.1 as existing project in your workspace
(Edit DBUtils as per your DB settings)

Revise
1.1 Servlet-JDBC integration
1.2 Page Navigation : redirect scenario
(MJUST check the net traffic: inspect option)

2. Hands on
Add a Cookie to perform session tracking.

3. MUST solve : New Voter registration
Add a link on login.html , New Voter
Clicking on link , show Voter registration form
Think about which request data , you will add in the form ?
Options : id , first_name , last_name , email             , password , dob        , status , role
Submit it to RegisterVoterServlet
Here you add a validation rule. 
Voter's age > 21 . If yes insert voter details in DB (using DAO n POJO , DBUtils)
Otherwise , give suitable error mesg. 

Reading exercise
1. day2-data\day2_help\readmes\regarding HttpServlet.txt
2. day2-data\day2_help\page navigation\page navigation techniques.txt
(only client pull)
3. day2-data\day2_help\session tracking\regarding session tracking.txt
(till cookie based session tracking)

Today's sequence.txt , will tell you what all we did today!

Day 3
MANDATORY REVISION
1. import day3.1 as existing project in your workspace
(Edit DBUtils as per your DB settings)
Revise
1.1 Servlet life cycle
1.2 Redirect
1.3 Session Tracking using HttpSession
1.4 Dynamic form generation in Candidate List page

2.OPTIONAL assignments
2.1 New User registration (discussed yesterday)
2.2 Complete admin flow of the online voting assignment
2.3 IPL Player selection assignment

Without taking pressure , try to solve any of above assignment , to get servlet practice.
